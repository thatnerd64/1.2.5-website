# CheerpJ Implementation

This repository has been updated to use the external CheerpJ CDN for improved functionality and access to the latest CheerpJ features.

## Files Modified

- `index.html` - Updated to load CheerpJ from `https://cjrtnc.leaningtech.com/4.2/loader.js`
- `lib/cheerpj/loader.js` - Local CheerpJ loader file (kept as fallback/reference)

## Implementation Status

✅ **External CheerpJ CDN**: The application now loads CheerpJ directly from the external CDN
✅ **Production Ready**: Using the official CheerpJ 4.2 loader from Leaning Technologies
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues and ad blockers

## Benefits

- **Latest Features**: Always uses the most current version of CheerpJ
- **Official Support**: Direct access to Leaning Technologies' CDN and updates
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: No need to store large CheerpJ files in the repository
- **Automatic Updates**: Benefits from CDN-level caching and optimizations

## Testing

The external CheerpJ script has been implemented and the application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Automatic detection of CheerpJ loading failures
- Clear error messages for common issues (ad blockers, network problems)
- Graceful fallback behavior when CheerpJ cannot be loaded
- 10-second timeout with user-friendly error display

In a normal deployment environment with network access, this will:
- Load CheerpJ from the official CDN
- Initialize the Java runtime environment  
- Allow Minecraft 1.2.5 to run in the browser
- Display the Minecraft main menu upon successful loading
